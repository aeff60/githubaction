# GitHub Actions Demo

This is a simple demonstration of how to use GitHub Actions for continuous integration (CI) in a JavaScript project.

## Project Structure

- `.github/workflows/main.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow that runs on push or pull request.
- `src/index.js`: Main JavaScript file of the application.
- `test/test.js`: Test file for the application.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for npm.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Workflow

The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. It is triggered on every push or pull request event. The workflow checks out the code, installs the dependencies listed in `package.json`, and runs the tests defined in `test/test.js`.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. Once you have these, you can install the dependencies and start the application:

```bash
npm install
node src/index.js
```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run the tests defined in `test/test.js`.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
